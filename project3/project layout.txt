Iris Data Set Questions

(1) - ***The most robust flower in regards to size*** - Of the three different classes of flowers, plot theaverage aggregation of each flower's length and width. (Essentially, Calculate: avg sepal length + avg sepal width, + avg petal length, + avg petal width then plot this on a bar chart with it's corresponding flower class.)

(2) - ***Iris sepal width vs petal width*** 

(3) - Sepal length distribution amongst Iris-Setosa (Histogram)
